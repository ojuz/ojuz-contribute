Paste the link to the problem.

**Target submission**
There should be at least one target submission, and it shouldn't be artificially crafted just to be wrong.

**Test input / output**
Provide the link to the test.

**Which subtask?**
If the problem has subtasks, please tell which subtask the test belongs to.

**Does it satisfy the input constraints?**
Read the problem statement carefully, and write how you verified your input actually satisfies the input constraint from the problem statement. A possible way is to write a validator, give the validator code to me, and say that your test passes the validator.

Tell me how your test was generated.
